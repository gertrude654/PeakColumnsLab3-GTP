# Peak Columns Finder

## Description
This Java program searches a given matrix for elements that are both a maximum in their row and a minimum in their column. These elements are called peak-columns. 

## How It Works
1. **Input**: A 2D array (matrix) of integers.
2. **Processing**:
    - For each element in the matrix, the program checks if it is the maximum in its row.
    - If it is the maximum in its row, the program then checks if it is the minimum in its column.
3. **Output**: The program prints the positions and values of all peak-columns.
